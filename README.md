# JWTweak

### Introduction
With the global increase in JSON Web Token (JWT) usage, the attack surface has also increased significantly. Having said that, this tool is designed with the aim to automate the attacks and various test cases pertaining to JWT. This would help security enthusiasts to find security flaws in JWT implementation with little or no time. 

#### Features
- Detect the algorithm of the input JWT Token 
- Base64 decode the input JWT Token 
- Generate new JWT Token by changing the algorithm of the input JWT to 'None' 
- Generate new JWT Token by changing the algorithm of the input JWT to 'HS256' 
- Generate new JWT Token by changing the algorithm of the input JWT to 'HS384' 
- Generate new JWT Token by changing the algorithm of the input JWT to 'HS512' 
                    

### Changelogs
#### Version-1.0 (28-Apr-2020)
#### Feature
- Option to Detect the algorithm of the input JWT
- Base64 decode the input JWT Token
- Generate new JWT Token by changing algorthim to `None` and `HS256/384/512`
