# JWTweak

### Introduction
With the global increase in JSON Web Token (JWT) usage, the attack surface has also increased significantly. Having said that, this utility is designed with the aim to generate the new JWT token with little or no time which would help security enthusiasts to find security flaws in JWT implementation. 

#### Features
- Detect the algorithm used by provided JWT Token 
- Base64 decode the provided JWT Token 
- Generate new JWT Token by changing the algorithm of the provided JWT to 'None' 
- Generate new JWT Token by changing the algorithm of the provided JWT to 'HS256' 
- Generate new JWT Token by changing the algorithm of the provided JWT to 'HS384' 
- Generate new JWT Token by changing the algorithm of the provided JWT to 'HS512'
